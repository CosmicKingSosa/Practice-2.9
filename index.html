<h2 style="background-color:Tomato;">NBA Finals Greates Player</h2>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;"> Lebron is the greatest player in NBA history! Not only can bring a team to the NBA Finals all on his lonesome. But he actually makes you have a chance and a damn good one at that. Lebron James performs the greatest in the NBA Finals out of any player that has ever walked the earth, he leads his teams in every stat catagory and carries them to wins. </p>
<h3 style="background-color:Tomato;">The Teams He Played For</h3>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;"> Lebron single handedly raised the Cleveland Cavaliers as a organization in the NBA. When he was drafted they were no longer a lottery team, they were contenders and contenders to win it all. After he left they became a lottery team and were terrible, one of the worst teams in the league. If you look at them now they went from going to 4 straight finals to winning less than 20 games out of 82 games.</p>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;"> We will make a break here.<br> A break can be used anywhere.  It is a line break.</p>
